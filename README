Iterator::DBI version 0.02
==========================

This module provides an Iterator interface to DBI queries.

See the Iterator module (and DBI module, I suppose) for more info.


EXAMPLES

Synopsis:

    $rows = idb_rows ($dbh, <<END_SQL);
SELECT * FROM my_table
WHERE my_column > 3742
END_SQL

    my $row = $rows->value;


DEVELOPMENT STATE

This is a brand-new module.  It should be considered "beta" software,
and used with care.

If you find any bugs, or if any behavior of Iterator surprises you,
I would be grateful if you could send me an email message about it.
Thanks.
